##  Overview
This project explores the intricate relationship between **remote work**, **job satisfaction**, **mental health**, and **productivity** across various industries and regions. Conducted during my time as a **Junior Data Analyst Intern at Vephla University (under Vephla Group)**, this project combined **Microsoft Excel**, **Power BI**, and basic survey validation to deliver actionable workforce insights.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì Data modelling, pivot tables, dashboards
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Interactive visuals, advanced chart types
- **Google Forms** ‚Äì Primary data collection (for validation)
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Project documentation and portfolio showcase

---

##  Objectives
- To analyse how different work modes (remote, hybrid, onsite) impact employee **productivity**, **stress**, and **job satisfaction**.
- To examine **company support**, **mental health resources**, and **virtual meeting frequency** as influencing factors.
- To recommend **data-backed strategies** for improving workforce wellness in modern work environments.

---

##  Dataset
- **Primary Source**: [Kaggle ‚Äì Remote Work and Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health)
- **Secondary Source**: A brief internal survey was conducted using Google Forms, validating similar patterns.
- **Data Structure**: Each row represents an employee‚Äôs experience. Columns cover demographics, work mode, stress, mental health, and productivity.

---

## Data Preparation
- No missing values or duplicate entries
- No major transformations were necessary
- Introduced a **Data Dictionary** for better stakeholder clarity
- Segregated variables into:
  - **Independent**: Gender, Age, Region, Work Mode, Industry
  - **Dependent**: Satisfaction, Stress Level, Productivity Change

---

##  Key Insights

### Actionable Findings
- Employees who reported **poor sleep** were more likely to experience decreased productivity.
- **Frequent virtual meetings (8+)** strongly correlated with **higher stress levels**.
- **Africa** had the **lowest access to mental health resources**, yet high report rates of mental conditions.
- **Company support** was a critical factor for remote work satisfaction.

### Optimisations & Recommendations
- Introduce **mental health coverage** as part of staff insurance
- Promote **flexible scheduling** and **hybrid arrangements**
- Encourage **shorter virtual meetings** and fewer per day
- Offer **commute support** or flexible resumption for on-site staff

###  Unexpected Outcomes
- Remote work did **not** always reduce stress ‚Äî without support, it could increase it
- Employees working **on-site but close to work** reported lower stress than expected
- **Burnout was prevalent** in roles like Data Science, Management, and Design

##  Visualisations

###  Excel Dashboards (2 Pages)
- Donut Chart: Work Mode Distribution
- 100% Stacked Bar: Mental Health by Job Role
- Line Chart: Productivity Change vs Years of Experience
- Clustered Charts: Stress by Region, Satisfaction by Work Mode
- Treemaps, Pie Charts, etc.

###  Power BI Report
- Used **Gauge, Ribbon, Funnel**, and **Decomposition Tree**
- Created a **multi-line chart** showing productivity across experience bands
- Included a **map chart** to show regional distribution

---

##  Limitations
- Data was regional, not country-specific
- No time-based variables (e.g., no way to compare pre- vs post-pandemic trends)
- Primary survey responses were skimmed due to time constraints

---

##  Future Improvements
- Collect more detailed **country-level data**
- Introduce **timestamps** to observe trends over time
- Expand dataset to include **qualitative feedback** from employees
